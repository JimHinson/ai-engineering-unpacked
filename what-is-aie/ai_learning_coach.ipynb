      "\n",
      "Think of it like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Machine Learning:** A broad field where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed.\n",
      "*   **Neural Networks:** Inspired by the human brain, these networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.\n",
      "*   **Deep Learning:** Neural networks with many layers. These layers allow the network to learn complex patterns and representations from raw data, like images, text, or sound, automatically extracting features that would traditionally need to be engineered by hand. This feature extraction capability is a key advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** Deep learning excels at tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and more because it can automatically learn intricate features from data using deep, multi-layered neural networks.\n",
